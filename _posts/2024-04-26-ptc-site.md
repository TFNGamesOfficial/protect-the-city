# New Protect The City site available!
by **DevGames**

**April 27th, 2024**



We've launched a new website for Protect The City!


### Why?
All of our gamemodes received a new website! We have a site for [Battle Royale](/battle-royale), [Creative & Unreal Editor for DevNite](/create) and [Protect The City](/protect-the-city). We published new websites so you can easily find news and more on the specific site and not on one site with news for all.

### Are there any changes?
Yes! All sites received a new Navbar and Website style. The Creative and UEDN site even got a new Documentation design!
